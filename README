USense
------

This package is based off of my 'Aquaria' aquariam controller project,
and I felt that the USB sensors component would be more generally
useful.

Have fun!

Compiling
---------

If you've checked this out from the repository, you will notice
that the 'configure' file is missing. Not a problem! Just run:

 $ ./autoconf.sh

That builds the 'configure' file, and all the automake and autoconf
support files. From there, just run:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
