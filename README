USense
------

This package is based off of my 'Aquaria' aquarium controller project,
and I felt that the USB sensors component would be more generally
useful.

Have fun!

Compiling
---------

Make sure you are running something current. Ubuntu 8.10 or
later is recommended. I have not tested this code on
any earlier distibution. A kernel later than 2.6.30 is
recommended.

If you've checked this out from the repository, you will notice
that the 'configure' file is missing. Not a problem! Just run:

 $ autoreconf -i

That builds the 'configure' file, and all the automake and autoconf
support files. From there, just run:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Using
-----

If you have a later model TEMPer, you will
need to run the following command to prevent
the build-in kernel HID driver from 'stealing' it.

 $ sudo rmmod usbhid

To list the available devices:

 $ usense
 usb:003.1
 usb:003.2
 usb:004.1

Get the properties of a device

 $ usense usb:003.2
 device=usb:003.2
 calibrate.add=-0.05
 calibrate.mul=1.002
 reading=27
 type=temp
 units=C
 usb.product=0002
 usb.vendor=08f7

Get a single property of a device:

 $ usense usb:003.2 reading
 27

Configuration
-------------

 $ usense usb:003.2
 device=usb:003.2
 calbrate.add=-0.05
 calbrate.mul=1.002
 reading=27
 type=temp
 units=C
 usb.product=0002
 usb.vendor=08f7

Set properties on the command line, *before* the property
you want to read:

 $ usense usb:003.2 calibrate.mul=1.003 units=F reading
 106
